# 6.scDIOR_vs_loom

The h5 file is superior to loom file in data structure design, which has the ability to save and transform categorical data accurately compared to loom file. The h5 file unified structure design and data IO method, which is more stable in data IO compared to loom file. Even with cross-platform data IO, h5 has fidelity to categorical (factor) data.
